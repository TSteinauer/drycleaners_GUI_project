# drycleaners_GUI_project 12/3/2023
JavaFX Application for Dry Cleaners. The user is the cashier and will use the application to clock in and out, add customers, accept orders from customers, and  ring orders out for customers
Step 1. Run the program from the HelloApplication.java file (I created this project in IntelliJ)
Step 2. It should bring up a login screen where you fill in the first and last name text areas with your first and last name. For the 4-digit key pick a 4-digit number that you can easily remember. 
(Sorry 7777 and 8888 are taken as my test cases feel free to delete these files if you really like these numbers.)
Step 3. After hitting submit on the login page if everything is filled correctly a Home button will appear which you will click to take you to the home welcoming page of the application.
Step 4. Assuming you're at the home page there will be side tabs that are clickable on the left side of the window. In order it will appear as Home, Find Customer, Clothes Tag In, Order Pick Up, Clock In/out, Logout
The flow of using the program goes like this
-Cashier logs in
-Cashier Clocks in by putting their Key(from the login) as well as the date in their respective text areas
-After clocking in Customer can wait till a customer comes in
-Boom customer walks in with 5 shirts and 4 pairs of jeans
-Ok so the cashier asks the customer hey picking up or dropping off?
-customers like I'm new and I'm just dropping off
-great! now you as the cashier will go to the find customer window by clicking that side square that says "find customer"
-This will take you to a jarring looking page. dont worry its easy to work with
-since it is a new customer youre dealing with you will type in the PINK NEW CUSTOMER section the customers first name, last name, and phone number (can type in any form but be consistent throughout because youll have to type it in multiple different areas. I recommend doing the xxx-xxx-xxxx.) in their respective prompted text areas.
-Hit add cust and BOOOM the table will add the new customer info. 
-Their wont be many customers as of now but you can still use the find customer box at the bottom. just type the phone number exactly the way its displayed in the Phone# column of the table and hit the Find Cust button
- boom this should send that customer's row flying to the top. This will be useful if you're running a successful dry cleaners.
- you will notice a weird little open order button at the end of that customers row. Don't worry about just now, just remember its there.
- Now you will move on to the Clothes Tag in window (again by clicking the square that says Clothes Tag In)
- Here, Boom, you will enter the customers phone number and clothes/clothes information.
- He had 5 shirts lets say two were  blue and the other three were red. Start by grouping the blue shirts together and fill out the order survey for those two shirts. then hit submit and do it for the 3 other shirts
- Then do it for the jeans.
- for the tag in ID usually dry cleaners have literal tags like these http://www.strylenkoff.com/shirt-tags.html so just put a number it doesn't really matter just make it unique
- so by the end you should have submitted 3 orders 1 order with 2 shirts 1 with 3 shirts and 1 with 3 jeans
- pretend your drycleaners can clean clothes in 2 seconds. The customer can pickup!
- Now remember that but in the find customer table, I told you to remember? WEll go back to find customer and click that thing
- Boom if you have a decent system a default text editor should pop up with guess what? the orders you just submitted!!!
- Awesome you can minimize it. and go to the Order pick up window
- from there just put in the customer phone number and order #/ID. IF you dont remember dont worry its in that text editor I had you minimize just a moment ago. All the relevant information will be there
- once filled out hit the submit button
- B O O M. in the text area below should be the order you want to check out. Confirm that it is and then hit ok at the side.
- Nice now do this for all the orders.
- IK its not the most intuitive process but it'll get the job done. In the future I may add more things to make it more legit.
- Oh yea dont forget to clock out so you can get paid silly
- and then logout
